# Ecommerce-Purchase-Data-Analysis
## Project Sumary 
### This project focuses on analyzing an e-commerce dataset using **SQL** to uncover insights into customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends. 
The database was designed with normalized tables including Customers, Products, Orders, Order Details, and Engagement to establish relationships for efficient querying and analysis. SQL queries and measures include calculating total revenue, sales by product category, and analyzing discounts and engagement metrics. The dataset provides a comprehensive view of transaction and customer activity, making it an excellent resource for business analysis and decision-making.
